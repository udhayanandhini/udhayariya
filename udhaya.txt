Predictive Modelling: Apply AI algorithms to develop predictive models for future company
registrations.
Model Evaluation: 
   Evaluate the predictive models using appropriate metrics, such as accuracy and
precision. 
The Measure of Measuring Rate of Change:
   Rate of change is an extremely important financial concept because it allows investors to spot
security momentum and other trends.
   Rate of change is also a good indicator of market bubbles. Even though momentum is good and
traders look for securities with a positive ROC, if a broad-market ETF, index, or mutual fund has a
sharp increase in its ROC in the short term, it may be a sign that the market is unsustainable. If
the ROC of an index or other broad-market security is over 50%, investors should be wary of a
bubble.
The price change of indicator:
   The rate of change is most often used to measure the change in a security’s price over time. This
is also known as the price rate of change (also abbreviated ROC). The price rate of change can be
derived by taking the price of a security at time B minus the price of the same security at time A
and dividing that result by the price at time A.
What Are Other Terms for Rate of Change?

   Rate of change may go by other terms depending on the context. With respect to speed or
velocity, for instance, acceleration/deceleration is the rate of change. In statistics and regression
modeling, the rate of change is defined by the slope of the line of best fit. For populations, it is
the growth rate. In financial markets, rate of change is often referred to as momentum.                                      How Do You Solve Rate of Change Problems?
   Rate of change problems can generally be approached using the formula R = D/T, or rate of
change equals the distance traveled divided by the time it takes to do so. Depending on the
context involved in the problem, “distance” can be replaced with something else, like change in
value or price.
How Do Traders Use the Price Rate of Change Indicator?
    The price rate of change (ROC) indicator is used in technical analysis to measure momentum. A
positive ROC can confirm a bullish trend while a negative ROC indicates a bearish one. When the
price is consolidating, the ROC will hover near zero.

     Time series forcasting in artificial intelligence
Time Series pertains to the sequence of observations collected in constant time
intervals, be it daily, monthly, quarterly or yearly. Time Series Analysis involves
developing models used to describe the observed time series and understand the &quot;why&quot;

mbl Ensee methods for improving RoC
   Ensemble methods aim at improving predictability in models by combining several
models to make one very reliable model. The most popular ensemble methods
are boosting, bagging, and stacking.
Ensemble technique in machine learning
   Ensemble methods is a machine learning technique that combines several base models
in order to produce one optimal predictive model . To better understand this definition
lets take a step back into ultimate goal of machine learning and model building
Deep learning architecture to improve the prediction
   Deep learning programs have multiple layers of interconnected nodes, with each layer
building upon the last to refine and optimize predictions and classifications. Deep
learning performs nonlinear transformations to its input and uses what it learns to create
a statistical model as output.

AI algorithms
   So, at the essential level, an AI algorithm is the programming that tells the computer
how to learn to operate on its own. An AI algorithm is much more complex than what
most people learn about in algebra, of course. A complex set of rules drive AI programs,
determining their steps and their ability to learn.

Loading and Processing Dataset RoC Analysis
Processing data in a Dataset
? Datasets provides many methods to modify a Dataset, be it to reorder, split or
shuffle the dataset or to apply data processing functions or evaluation functions
to its elements.
? We’ll start by presenting the methods which change the order or number of
elements before presenting methods which access and can change the content
of the elements themselves.

Methods
The areas under two ROC curves, that are generated from either independent
groups or paired subjects, are compared. Comparing two ROC curves can
provide more information in the accuracy resulted from two comparative

Obtaining an ROC analysis
? Click Classification to define the cutoff value, test direction, and standard error of
area under the curve.
? Click Statistics to select which statistics to include in the procedure.
? Click Plots to define plotting for the ROC and Precision-Recall curves.
Is roc good for imbalanced datasets?
? ROC curves can sometimes be misleading in some very imbalanced applications. A
ROC curve can still look pretty good (ie better than random) while misclassifying most or
all of the minority class. In contrast, PR curves are specifically tailored for the detection
of rare events and are pretty useful in those scenarios.

Data considerations
? Data
PR curves plot Precision versus Recall, and tend to be more informative when the
observed data samples are highly skewed. A simple linear interpolation may
mistakenly yield an overly-optimistic estimate of a PR curve.
? Assumptions
The prediction will be in the correct order when a test variable is observed for one
subject that is randomly selected from the case group and the other is randomly
selected from the control group. Each defined group will contain at least one valid
observation. Only a single grouping variable is used for a single procedure.
How do you manually plot a ROC curve?
All we need to do, based on different threshold values, is to compute True Positive Rate
(TPR) and False Positive Rate (FPR) values for each of the thresholds and then plot
TPR against FPR. When you obtain True Positive Rate and False Positive Rate for

In finance, the calculation for ROC can also be computed as a return over time, in that it
can takes the current value of a stock or index and divides it by the value from an earlier
period. Subtract one and multiply the resulting number by 100 to give it a percentage
representation.
Limitations of ROC curves
Confidence scores used to build ROC curves may be difficult to assign. False-positive
and false-negative diagnoses have different misclassification costs. Excessive ROC
curve extrapolation is undesirable. Net benefit methods may provide more meaningful
and clinically interpretable results than ROC AUC.
Two parameters of the ROC curve
An ROC curve (receiver operating characteristic curve) is a graph showing the
performance of a classification model at all classification thresholds. This curve plots
two parameters: True Positive Rate. False Positive Rate.

Key metrics on the ROC curve include:
1. True Positive Rate (TPR): This is the ratio of correctly predicted positive instances to the total
number of actual positives. It corresponds to the y-axis of the ROC curve.
2. False Positive Rate (FPR): This is the ratio of incorrectly predicted positive instances to the total
number of actual negatives. It corresponds to the x-axis of the ROC curve.
Constructing a ROC Curve
Let&#39;s break down the steps involved in constructing a ROC curve using Python and sci-
kit-learn:
Step 1: Importing Necessary Packages
I started by importing the essential libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, CSV, random,
and Matplotlib. These libraries facilitate data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
Step 2: Generating Synthetic Data for ROC Curve Analysis
I then generate a synthetic dataset. The dataset I created had two columns: &#39;probability&#39;
(predicted probabilities) and &#39;actual_label&#39; (true labels). This dataset serves as the
foundation for constructing the ROC curve.
Step 3: Loading the Synthetic Data into a Data Frame
I proceeded to load the generated data into a Pandas data frame to facilitate data
manipulation and analysis.
Step 4: Visualizing Data Distribution and Overlapping in Scatter PLOT 
Next, I create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between &#39;probability&#39; values and
&#39;actual_label&#39; outcomes. This step illustrates the challenge of finding a single separation
line due to data overlap.
Step 5: Constructing and Analyzing the ROC Curve
Below are the steps to create the ROC Curve:
? Extract model outputs and actual labels from the data.
? Compute ROC metrics using the roc_curve function, including FPRs, TPRs, and thresholds.
? Calculate AUROC (Area Under the ROC Curve) using the AUC function.
? Visualize the ROC curve with TPR vs. FPR. Include a baseline for random guessing.
? Display the calculated AUROC value to summarize the model&#39;s overall performance.

with the primary duty of registering companies and LLPs floated in the
respective states and the Union Territories and ensuring that such companies
and LLPs comply with statutory requirements under the Act. These offices
function as registry of records, relating to the companies registered with

The different feature engineering techniques examples:
In this blog, we will look at the following feature engineering techniques and understand
their implementations:
? Scaling.
? Normalization.
? Standardization.
? One hot encoding.
? Ordinal Encoding.
? Bucketing/Binning.
? Bag of words.
? Derived Features.
Feature based modeling techniques:
Feature-based modeling is the traditional and predominant method of creating 3D
models in CAD/CAM software, which requires defining the geometry and topology of the
model by adding and subtracting features such as sketches, extrusions, fillets, holes,
and patterns.
What is feature engineering?
Feature engineering is a machine learning technique that leverages data to create new
variables that aren’t in the training set. It can produce new features for both supervised
and unsupervised learning, with the goal of simplifying and speeding up data
transformations while also enhancing model accuracy. Feature engineering is
required when working with machine learning models. Regardless of the data or
architecture, a terrible feature will have a direct impact on your model.

Feature engineering consists of various process :

? Feature Creation: Creating features involves creating new variables which will
be most helpful for our model. This can be adding or removing some features. As we
saw above, the cost per sq. ft column was a feature creation.
? Transformations: Feature transformation is simply a function that transforms
features from one representation to another. The goal here is to plot and visualise
data, if something is not adding up with the new features we can reduce the number
of features used, speed up training, or increase the accuracy of a certain model.
? Feature Extraction: Feature extraction is the process of extracting features
from a data set to identify useful information. Without distorting the original
relationships or significant information, this compresses the amount of data into
manageable quantities for Exploralgorithms to process.
· atory Data Analysis : Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is a powerful
and simple tool that can be used to improve your understanding of your data, by
exploring its properties. The technique is often applied when the goal is to create
new hypotheses or find patterns in the data. It’s often used on large amounts of
qualitative or quantitative data that haven’t been analyzed before.
? Benchmark: A Benchmark model is the end of this article. Now, let’s have a
look at why we need feature engineering in machine learning. : A Benchmark Model
is the most user-friendly, dependable, transparent, and interpretable model against
which you can measure your own. It’s a good idea to run test datasets to see if your
new machine learning model outperforms a recognised benchmark. These
benchmarks are often used as measures for comparing the performance between

different machine learning models like neural networks and support vector
machines, linear and non-linear classifiers, or different approaches like bagging and
boosting. To learn more about feature engineering steps and process, check the links

Feature Engineering is a very important step in machine learning. Feature engineering
refers to the process of designing artificial features into an algorithm. These artificial
features are then used by that algorithm in order to improve its performance, or in other
words reap better results. Data scientists spend most of their time with data, and it
becomes important to make models accurate.https://vmblog.com/images/time-spent-data-scientist.png

When feature engineering activities are done correctly, the resulting dataset is optimal
and contains all of the important factors that affect the business problem. As a result of
these datasets, the most accurate predictive models and the most useful insights are
produced.

Feature Engineering Techniques for Machine Learning:
Lets see a few feature engineering best techniques that you can use. Some of the
techniques listed may work better with certain algorithms or datasets, while others may
be useful in all situations.

1.Imputation

When it comes to preparing your data for machine learning, missing values are one of the
most typical issues. Human errors, data flow interruptions, privacy concerns, and other
factors could all contribute to missing values. Missing values have an impact on the
performance of machine learning models for whatever cause. The main goal of
imputation is to handle these missing values. :

? Numerical Imputation: To figure out what numbers should be assigned to
people currently in the population, we usually use data from completed surveys or
censuses. These data sets can include information about how many people eat
different types of food, whether they live in a city or country with a cold climate, and
how much they earn every year. That is why numerical imputation is used to fill gaps
in surveys or censuses when certain pieces of information are missing.

#Filling all missing values with 0

data = data.fillna(0)

? Categorical Imputation: When dealing with categorical columns, replacing
missing values with the highest value in the column is a smart solution. However, if

you believe the values in the column are evenly distributed and there is no
dominating value, imputing a category like “Other” would be a better choice, as your
imputation is more likely to converge to a random selection in this scenario.

#Max fill function for categorical columns

data[‘column_name’].fillna(data[‘column_name’].value_counts().idxmax(),
inplace=True)

2.Handling Outliers

Outlier handling is a technique for removing outliers from a dataset. This method can be
used on a variety of scales to produce a more accurate data representation. This has an
impact on the model’s performance. Depending on the model, the effect could be large or
minimal; for example, linear regression is particularly susceptible to outliers. This
procedure should be completed prior to model training. The various methods of handling
outliers include:

1. Removal: Outlier-containing entries are deleted from the distribution. However,
if there are outliers across numerous variables, this strategy may result in a big
chunk of the datasheet being missed.
2. Replacing values: Alternatively, the outliers could be handled as missing
values and replaced with suitable imputation.
3. Capping: Using an arbitrary value or a value from a variable distribution to
replace the maximum and minimum values.

4. Discretization : Discretization is the process of converting continuous
variables, models, and functions into discrete ones. This is accomplished by
constructing a series of continuous intervals (or bins) that span the range of our
desired variable/model/function.

3.Log Transform

Log Transform is the most used technique among data scientists. It’s mostly used to turn
a skewed distribution into a normal or less-skewed distribution. We take the log of the
values in a column and utilise those values as the column in this transform. It is used to
handle confusing data, and the data becomes more approximative to normal
applications.

//Log Example

df[log_price] = np.log(df[‘Price’])

4.One-hot encoding

A one-hot encoding is a type of encoding in which an element of a finite set is
represented by the index in that set, where only one element has its index set to “1” and
all other elements are assigned indices within the range [0, n-1]. In contrast to binary
encoding schemes, where each bit can represent 2 values (i.e. 0 and 1), this scheme
assigns a unique value for each possible case.

5.Scaling

Feature scaling is one of the most pervasive and difficult problems in machine learning,
yet it’s one of the most important things to get right. In order to train a predictive model,
we need data with a known set of features that needs to be scaled up or down as
appropriate. This blog post will explain how feature scaling works and why it’s important
as well as some tips for getting started with feature scaling.

After a scaling operation, the continuous features become similar in terms of range.
Although this step isn’t required for many algorithms, it’s still a good idea to do so.
Distance-based algorithms like k-NN and k-Means, on the other hand, require scaled
continuous features as model input. There are two common ways for scaling :

Normalization : All values are scaled in a specified range between 0 and 1 via
normalisation (or min-max normalisation). This modification has no influence on the
feature’s distribution, however it does exacerbate the effects of outliers due to lower
standard deviations. As a result, it is advised that outliers be dealt with prior to
normalisation.

Standardization: Standardization (also known as z-score normalisation) is the
process of scaling values while accounting for standard deviation. If the standard
deviation of features differs, the range of those features will likewise differ. The effect of
outliers in the characteristics is reduced as a result. To arrive at a distribution with a 0
mean and 1 variance, all the data points are subtracted by their mean and the result
divided by the distribution’s variance.

FeatureTools

Featuretools is a framework to perform automated feature engineering. It excels at
transforming temporal and relational datasets into feature matrices for machine
learning. Featuretools integrates with the machine learning pipeline-building tools you
already have. In a fraction of the time it would take to do it manually, you can load in
pandas dataframes and automatically construct significant features.

Model training 
Writing and running machine learning algorithms to produce an ML model is the central
component of the ML workflow. A data science team typically uses the model
engineering pipeline, which consists of several procedures, such as model testing,
model evaluation and model packaging, to create the final model.
You can streamline these activities in several ways. For example, you can automate the
machine learning model training process by building a pipeline, which makes it simpler
to scale the solution to larger datasets and maintain and update the model over time.

It is important to understand how crucial and interconnected the stages of model
training, evaluation and testing are in the machine-learning workflow. Model creation is
followed by model training, assessment of the model’s performance on a different
dataset and testing of the model on fresh or previously unexplored data. Since this
process is iterative, it may be necessary to repeat model training several times before
the model’s performance on the testing data is acceptable. 

The model training phase includes these steps/actions:
? Step1:Depending on the data you need and your learning objectives, choose the
appropriate algorithm.
? Step2:Choose the architecture, model variant or other parameters that will produce the
best results.
? Step3:Set up, fine-tune and create the model parameter values that a machine learning
algorithm eventually learns. The term “hyperparameter” refers to this regulatory
mechanism. In order to get the best results, the model version is chosen with the aid of
this hyperparameter adjustment. Examples include the number of layers, activation
function and learning rate in neural networks, which are all controlled via fine-tuning.  
? Step4:To demonstrate which hyperparameters and models are most effective for your
use case, benchmark them.
? Step5:Determine whether the model has the necessary level of explainability.
? Step6Consider using an ensemble technique, which involves running multiple models
concurrently, if applicable, or a more advanced technique if required by the business
challenges or objective.

Here are a few typical training approaches.
? Grid search: Training the model with all conceivable combinations of hyperparameters
while specifying a range of values for each one.
? Random search: Using a set of arbitrarily chosen hyperparameter values that fall within
a predetermined range.
? Bayesian optimization: This method employs a probabilistic model to forecast how
various hyperparameter values will perform and to pick the most promising ones for
training.
? Genetic algorithms: To discover the ideal collection of hyperparameters, genetic
algorithms evolve a population of potential hyperparameters over several generations.
? Manual tuning: Testing various hyperparameter values and evaluating the model’s
performance.

Model evaluation
Model evaluation measures how well a trained machine learning model works to make sure it
meets the original business objectives. The goal of model evaluation is to assess a model’s
ability to predict outcomes correctly and to pinpoint areas for improvement.  To assess a model,
a variety of methods can be applied, such as:
? Holdout technique: Data is divided into training and test sets. The model is developed on the
training set, and the test set is used to assess the model’s success.
? Bootstrapping: In this method, the model undergoes training using a series of newly
generated datasets. These datasets are crafted by resampling the original dataset, allowing the
same data point to appear multiple times within a resampled dataset. By employing this method
of replacement, the model&#39;s performance is evaluated based on the insights gathered from
these resampled datasets.
? Cross-validation: In this method, the data is divided into different subgroups, each of which is
used as a test set while the other subsets are used for training. This technique aids in lowering
the danger of over-fitting which can lead to poor predictive performance.
? Metrics: Depending on the kind of issue being solved, different metrics can be used to assess
how well a machine learning model is performing. Accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, AUC-
ROC and mean squared error are a few typical measures.
? Visual inspection: In some circumstances, the output of the model can be visually inspected
to assess the success of the model. For instance, in image classification, the model’s success
can be evaluated by comparing its predictions to the labels applied.

Model testing
Model testing in machine learning is the process of assessing how well a trained model
performs on a collection of data that it has never seen before. Model testing is done to
determine how well a model generalizes to new, unforeseen data and to predict how well it will
work in practice.
To prevent bias, the testing set should not be used in the training process and should be an
accurate representation of the real-world data that the model will meet. To provide a statistically
significant evaluation of the model’s performance, the testing set must be big enough. Decisions
about the model’s suitability for deployment in the actual world are then made based on the
outcomes of the model testing stage. 

Model packaging
Model packaging is the practice of combining a trained machine learning model with its related
pre- and post-processing steps, configuration files and other essential resources into a unique
package that can be readily distributed, deployed and used by others. The trained model can be
shared and used in various contexts, such as cloud-based or on-premises systems, thanks to
model packaging in the machine learning workflow. Depending on the unique requirements of
the use case, a model can be packaged using a variety of techniques. 
In this blog, we touched upon model training, evaluation and testing. The features of ML testing
include the need to verify the quality of the data as well as the model and the need to iteratively
tune the hyperparameters to achieve the best results. You can be certain of its performance if
you follow all the steps outlined.
